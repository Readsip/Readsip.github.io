         <h1>What Is Matter?</h1>

        <p>Matter is anything that takes up space and has weight. Okay cool — we hear that all the time. But hold on... </p>
        </section>

        <h4>What is Mass?</h4>
        <p> Mass is how much stuff is inside of something and it doesn't change no matter where you are (earth, moon, space…) while weight is how hard gravity pulls on that stuff. It can change depending on where you are. On the moon, you weigh less, but your mass stays the same.</p>
        <p> So some examples of matter are Air, water, and people.We use matter every second without thinking about it for example: drinking coffee is liquid matter and the cup itself is solid matter. The air we breath our phones are all made of different types of matter This means matter is super important.</p>

        <h4>What are the states of Matter?</h4>
        <p>Matter exists in several different forms, called states. most popular states are solid, liquid and gas.</p>

        <h4>What is matter made of?</h4>
        <p>Matter is made of atoms. Atoms are the tiny building blocks of everything in the universe. You can't see atoms with your eyes because they are so small. But what is inside an atom? Even though atoms are so tiny, they have three parts: 1.proton 2. Neutron 3. Electron . where are they located in an atom? -protons and neutrons are in the center of the atom in the nucleus . - electrons move around the center really fast.</p>

        <h4>How Does Understanding Matter Help You?</h4>
        <p>Imagine you walk into a lab. What can you do with matter?</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Build new materials:</strong> Scientists mix different atoms and molecules to create new materials — like super-strong metals for airplanes. A great example is Titanium alloy — it’s a metal engineered by mixing titanium with other elements like aluminum and vanadium.its Strong but Lightweight:
 It’s super strong (so the airplane parts won’t break easily) but much lighter than steel, which helps planes use less fuel. Its Resistant to Heat and Corrosion: It can handle high temperatures and doesn’t rust easily. Scientists understand how atoms of titanium, aluminum, and vanadium bond and behave together to create this special alloy. By mixing matter in the right way, they get a metal that’s better than pure titanium or steel for airplanes.</li>
          <li><strong>Make Medicine:</strong> Understanding matter helps chemists design drugs that can fight diseases by interacting with the atoms in your body.</li>
          <li><strong>Clean Energy:</strong> Labs work on new fuels and batteries — all by changing how atoms and molecules behave.</li>
          <li><strong>Everyday Stuff:</strong> Even cooking is about matter — heat changes the state of food (solid, liquid, gas).</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h4>So if everything is matter then what isn't?</h4>
        <p>Not everything is matter. Some things don’t have mass or take up space like:
Light isn't made of atoms. its made of photons. Its energy not matter. And sound is how energy moves through air and water it's not a matter, it's a form of energy.</p>
