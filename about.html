  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <p><strong>Who are you?</strong></p>
  <p>I'm Basmala, a high school student who built Readsip as a space to simplify the world around me — and share it with others.</p>

  <p><strong>Why did you start Readsip?</strong></p>
  <p>Honestly? Because I got tired of reading long, confusing articles that made simple things feel hard. I wanted a place that explains ideas clearly, in a fun and friendly way — like how I’d explain them to a friend.</p>

  <p><strong>What kind of topics do you write about?</strong></p>
  <p>Things I've always heard about but never really understood. I break them down in easy ways, with examples and real-life vibes.</p>

  <p><strong>Why should someone read Readsip?</strong></p>
  <p>If you're curious, but feel overwhelmed by complicated info, Readsip is for you. I believe learning should feel chill — not like homework.</p>

  <p><strong>What's next?</strong></p>
  <p>I'm always learning, and Readsip will grow with me. Maybe this is just the start — but it means a lot that you're here reading.</p>
